# Introduction

Charlists are created using the `~c` Sigil.

```elixir
~c"hello"
```

Note that in older versions of Elixir, charlists are represented as `'hello'` with single quotes.

Although they look very similar to strings, the two data types are quite different from one another. A charlist is a list of integers. The integers represent the Unicode values of a given character â€” also known as code points.

```elixir
[65, 66, 67]
# => ~c"ABC"
```

You can prepend a character with `?` to get its code point.

```elixir
?A
# => 65

[?:, ?)]
# => ~c":)"
```

Because charlist are lists, you can work with them just like with any other list - using recursion and pattern matching.

```elixir
[first_letter | _] = ~c"cat"
first_letter
# => 99
```

You can concatenate two lists using `++`.

```elixir
~c"hi" ++ ~c"!"
# => ~c"hi!"
```

The longer the first list is, the slower the concatenation, so avoid repeatedly appending to lists of arbitrary length.
